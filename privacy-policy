At miSafety, we prioritize the security of K-12 students and respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect personal information, including IP addresses, location data, and other sensitive information.
1. Data Collection
	•	Types of Data: We may collect location details, incident reports, IP addresses, user preferences, and basic device information.
	•	Chat-based Features: For AI-powered responses (e.g., mental health chatbot), your chat inputs may be sent to third-party providers for processing.
	•	Legal Compliance: Since we serve K-12 students, we adhere to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) when collecting or storing information about minors.
2. Data Usage
	•	Purpose: Collected information is used to provide real-time alerts, incident tracking, AI-based responses, location monitoring for emergency assistance, and overall platform improvements.
	•	Consent for Minors: Parents and guardians must provide consent for children’s data collection. Schools are responsible for ensuring these consent requirements are satisfied.
	•	Behavioral Monitoring: IP addresses, timestamps, and usage logs may be reviewed to detect unauthorized activity, respond to threats, or comply with legal obligations.
3. Data Storage and Protection
	•	Encryption: All data transmitted and stored is protected using industry-standard encryption methods to prevent unauthorized access.
	•	Secure Cloud Solutions: We rely on reputable third-party providers (e.g., Firebase) for data storage. These providers maintain high security standards and comply with relevant data protection regulations.
	•	Access Controls: Only authorized personnel, such as designated school officials or emergency responders, can access sensitive information for legitimate safety purposes.
4. Third-party Sharing
	•	No Marketing Disclosures: We do not sell or share your data with marketing entities or unrelated third parties.
	•	Emergency or Legal Requirements: Data may be shared with school authorities or law enforcement in emergencies, threats, or other safety incidents.
	•	External Services: In addition to cloud storage, we may integrate with AI providers (e.g., Hugging Face) or analytics services to enhance the platform’s functionality. These providers adhere to their own terms and privacy policies, which we review for compliance.
5. Parental Rights
	•	Data Review: Parents or guardians can request to review, delete, or restrict data pertaining to their child by contacting the school administrator or miSafety support.
	•	Verification: We may require identity verification or proof of guardianship to ensure the privacy and safety of minors.
